# 🗣️ Real-Time Language Translator  

## 📌 Project Overview  
The **Real-Time Language Translator** is a voice recognition-based translation tool that serves as a virtual interpreter, enabling seamless multilingual communication. The application listens to spoken input and translates it into the selected target language with both text and audio output.  

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
The project aims to create a **virtual interpreter** that facilitates real-time conversation between speakers of different languages by:  
- Recognizing speech input  
- Translating it into another language  
- Providing the output in text and speech format  

## 🚀 Features  
✔️ **Real-time Speech-to-Text & Text-to-Text Translation**  
✔️ **Multilingual Support**  
✔️ **Text-to-Speech for Audio Output**  
✔️ **Intuitive UI for Easy Language Selection**  
✔️ **One-to-Many Translation (Single input, multiple target languages)**  
✔️ **Database Storage for Translations (MongoDB)**  

## 📌 Technology Stack  
🔹 **Programming Languages**: Python, JavaScript  
🔹 **Frameworks**: Flask (Backend), Tkinter (GUI)  
🔹 **Libraries**:  
   - Speech Recognition: Vosk  
   - Text-to-Speech: pyttsx3  
   - Database: MongoDB  
   - Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
🔹 **APIs**: Offline models for speech recognition and translation  


## 🔄 Project Workflow  
1️⃣ **User selects** translation mode (Text-to-Text, Speech-to-Speech, One-to-Many)  
2️⃣ **User provides input** (Typed text or Spoken words via Microphone)  
3️⃣ **Preprocessing** (Speech-to-text conversion, Noise reduction, Language detection)  
4️⃣ **Translation** to the selected target language(s)  
5️⃣ **Output** (Translated text displayed, Speech generated for playback)  
6️⃣ **Data Storage** (Translations stored in MongoDB for future retrieval)
